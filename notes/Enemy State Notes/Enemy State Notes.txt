Proposed states of enemy (case sensitive):

idle:			no movement from enemy, can be standing, sitting, smoking, eating, etc
dead:			the end state of the enemy, no further actions can be committed by them
patrol:			walking along pre-determined path
wander:			aimlessly walking along random path, turning 90 degrees when bumping into walls
suspicious:		walk towards target location (targets including areas where noise was detected for example)
spotted:		aim / look towards declared target
attack:			use whichever weapon they have equipped
confused:		will stand still and look side to side for a few seconds, scratching head, before reverting to wandering
wounded:		will fall to ground, rendering them defenceless
suicide:		will pull out revolver and shoot themselves in the head


States specified in code that have not been declared & defined will automatically revert to "idle" as a form of validation.
